## üöÄ Project Overview

Tired of the manual grind of setting up a new project board? **AgileFlow AI** revolutionizes your workflow by leveraging the power of Generative AI. This isn't just another project management tool; it's a **GenAI-powered partner** that understands your project goals and kickstarts your Agile process in seconds.

Simply provide a high-level description of your project, and watch as AgileFlow AI intelligently suggests user stories, constructs a complete Kanban board with relevant epics and tasks, assigns story points, and even provides ongoing agile coaching. It's designed to eliminate the initial friction of project setup, allowing you and your team to focus on what truly matters: building great products.

## üß† How GenAI is Used

The magic of AgileFlow AI lies in a multi-step, AI-driven workflow orchestrated by **Genkit**. We use carefully designed prompts and schemas to ensure the AI's output is structured, relevant, and immediately usable.

### 1. AI-Powered User Story Suggestion
The process begins by transforming a simple project idea into actionable user stories.
- **Purpose**: To overcome "blank page" syndrome and provide a solid foundation for project planning.
- **Workflow**:
    1. You provide the project name, team members, and duration.
    2. The application sends these details to a **GenAI model (Gemini)**, prompting it to act as an expert Scrum Master.
    3. The AI generates a list of 5-8 relevant user stories in the standard "As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]" format.
    4. You are presented with these suggestions on a review screen, where you have full control to **add, edit, or delete** stories to perfectly match your vision.

### 2. AI-Powered Scrum Board Initialization
This is where the core value of AgileFlow AI shines. We turn your verified user stories into a fully structured project board.
- **Purpose**: To automate the tedious process of creating epics, breaking down stories into tasks, estimating effort, and assigning work.
- **Workflow**:
    1. Once you approve the user stories, they are sent to a second, more complex AI prompt.
    2. The AI is instructed to act as an expert Scrum Master and perform several actions at once:
        - **Generate Columns**: Create Kanban columns that represent high-level features or epics derived from the stories.
        - **Create Tasks**: Populate each column with smaller, actionable tasks needed to complete the feature.
        - **Estimate Story Points**: Assign story points (1, 2, 3, 5, 8) to each task to represent its complexity.
        - **Assign Team Members**: Intelligently distribute the tasks among the team members you provided.
    3. The AI returns a structured JSON object, which is used to render a complete, interactive Kanban board.

### 3. AI-Powered Contextual Agile Coaching
To help your team stay on track, AgileFlow AI provides continuous, context-aware advice.
- **Purpose**: To offer actionable best practices and improve your team's agile fluency.
- **Workflow**:
    1. At any point, you can click "Get Agile Tip".
    2. The application sends your current project context (e.g., "Project Phase: Execution") to the AI.
    3. The AI, acting as an agile assistant, provides a single, relevant tip and explains the **reasoning** behind its suggestion, helping you learn and adapt.
