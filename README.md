## üïπÔ∏è How It Works

The magic of AgileFlow AI lies in its simple yet powerful workflow that connects a user-friendly frontend with a smart AI backend.

1.  **Project Setup**: The user fills out a simple form with the project name, team members, and duration.
2.  **AI Invocation**: The frontend calls a **Next.js Server Action** (`generateBoardAction`).
3.  **Genkit Flow**: This action triggers the `initializeBoardFlow` in **Genkit**. The flow uses a carefully crafted prompt to instruct a Generative AI model to create a project structure.
4.  **Data Hydration**: The server action receives the AI's response and enriches it by adding unique IDs to each column and task. This is critical for React's rendering and the drag-and-drop functionality.
5.  **Board Rendering**: The complete board data is sent back to the client, where React renders the interactive `<ProjectBoard />`.
6.  **Interactive Management**: The user can now drag tasks, set dates, and get agile tips, with all state changes managed seamlessly on the client.
